# HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FRONTEND

## SOME IMPORTANT LIBRARIES FOR THE FRONTEND

### 1. Axios

Purpose: Axios is a popular HTTP client for making requests from the browser or Node.js. It is often used to communicate with APIs or fetch data from external sources.

Key Features:

Supports all HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
Automatically transforms JSON data.
Handles request and response interceptors.
Provides cancel tokens to abort requests.
Supports timeouts and error handling.
Works in both client-side (browser) and server-side (Node.js) environments.
Common Use Cases:

Fetching data from a REST API.
Sending data to a server.
Handling authentication (e.g., adding authorization headers).
Managing multiple concurrent requests.
Installation:

bash
npm install axios

Basic Example:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  });
  ```

#### 2. react-icons

Purpose: react-icons is a library that provides popular icons as React components, making it easy to integrate icons into a React application.

Key Features:

Includes icons from various popular libraries, such as Font Awesome, Material Design, Feather, and more.
Lightweight and customizable, supporting props like size, color, and className.
No need to manually import or manage individual icon assets.
Common Use Cases:

Displaying icons in UI components like buttons, navigation bars, or status indicators.
Enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of a React application.
Installation:

npm install react-icons
Basic Example:

```javascript
import { FaCoffee } from 'react-icons/fa';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Let's have a coffee! <FaCoffee /></h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 3. react-multi-carousel

      <div>Item 3</div>
      <div>Item 4</div>
    </Carousel>
  );
}
```

#### 4. react-router-dom

Purpose: react-router-dom is a package for routing in React applications. It allows you to manage navigation and URLs, enabling a single-page application (SPA) to have multiple views.

Key Features:

Supports declarative routing using components like `<Route>, <Switch>, <Link>, <NavLink>`, etc.
Allows nested routing and route parameters.
Provides hooks (useHistory, useParams, useLocation) to manage navigation programmatically.
Offers easy integration with the browser's history API.
Common Use Cases:

Creating multi-page navigation in a single-page React application.
Implementing dynamic URLs with parameters (e.g., /user/:id).
Controlling access to certain pages (protected routes).
Installation:

npm install react-router-dom
Basic Example:

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Home() {
  return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
}

function About() {
  return <h2>About Page</h2>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

#### 5. react-toastify

Purpose: react-toastify is a React library for creating customizable toast notifications. It allows you to display brief messages (toasts) that appear and disappear after a short duration.

Key Features:

Supports different types of notifications (info, success, warning, error, etc.).
Allows for customization of the position, auto-close time, transition effects, and more.
Simple API and easy to integrate with any React application.
Supports rich content (HTML, components) within toasts.
Common Use Cases:

Showing success or error messages after form submissions.
Providing real-time feedback on user actions (e.g., "Item added to cart").
Displaying alerts or warnings to users.
Installation:

npm install react-toastify
Basic Example:

```javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify';
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css';

function App() {
  const notify = () => toast("Wow! This is a toast notification!");

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={notify}>Show Toast</button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Conclusion

Each of these packages plays a specific role in building React and Node.js applications, ranging from handling HTTP requests (axios), adding icons (react-icons), creating carousels (react-multi-carousel), managing routes (react-router-dom), and displaying notifications (react-toastify). Understanding how to use these libraries effectively can greatly enhance your development process and application functionality.
